   syncing hw clock to system clock
   https://access.redhat.com/solutions/55432
     You should be aware of another way that the Hardware Clock is kept syn-
       chronized  in  some  systems.   The  Linux kernel has a mode wherein it
       copies the System Time to the Hardware Clock every 11 minutes.  This is
       a  good mode to use when you are using something sophisticated like ntp
       to keep your System Time synchronized. (ntp is a way to keep your  Sys-
       tem  Time synchronized either to a time server somewhere on the network
       or to a radio clock hooked up to your system.  See RFC 1305).

       This mode (we’ll call it "11 minute mode") is off until something turns
       it  on.   The  ntp daemon xntpd is one thing that turns it on.  You can
       turn it off by running anything, including hwclock --hctosys, that sets
       the System Time the old fashioned way.

       To see if it is on or off, use the command adjtimex --print and look at
       the value of "status".  If the "64" bit of this  number  (expressed  in
       binary) equal to 0, 11 minute mode is on.  Otherwise, it is off.

       If  your system runs with 11 minute mode on, don’t use hwclock --adjust
       or hwclock --hctosys.  You’ll just make a mess.  It  is  acceptable  to
       use a hwclock --hctosys at startup time to get a reasonable System Time
       until your system is able to set the  System  Time  from  the  external
       source and start 11 minute mode.
