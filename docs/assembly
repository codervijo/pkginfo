1, Assembly syntax when you read various documents:
    there are AT&T syntax and Intel syntax.
   In Intel documents, it is usually in Intel syntax.
   With GNU tool chains, the default syntax used is usually the AT&T one.
2, The most significant different between these 2 syntaxes is that
   AT&T and Intel syntax use the opposite order for 
   source and destination operands.
   Intel syntax uses "dest, source" while the AT&T syntax uses "source, dest". 
3, For the representation of operands with the SIB or displacement,
   the formats are different. 
   For example, the Intel syntax is [rdi+0xa] for 0xa(%rdi) in AT&T syntax.
   For a list of notable differences,
   please check AT&T Syntax versus Intel Syntax :
