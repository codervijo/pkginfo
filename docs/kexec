Kexec + Kdump
=============

What is it?
    Kexec enables booting into a new kernel while
    preserving the memory contents in a crash sce-
    nario,  and kdump uses this feature to capture
    the kernel crash dump

So you can :
    1, Boot into same kernel again without going through BIOS (fast reboot)
    2, Boot into small capture kernel and get dumps after a crash/panic
    3, Provide a way to quickly provide user space with "fresh slate",
       assuming it is only a software issue and not hardware problem.

HowTo
    1, Build kernel with kexec support
    2, Also add CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y to kernel config
    3, change grub config/kernel cmdline with addition "crashkernel=256"
    4, install kexec-utils
    5, kexec -u
    6, kexec -l <params>
    7, kexec -e

Next steps :
DONE 1, Build kernels for kexec
DONE 2, Try it on a plat 5 device or centos 7 device
     3, Try kexec and kdump on one device
