Filesystems in Linux

Locking file
  1, https://gavv.github.io/blog/file-locks/
  2, flock for advisory locking
  3, fcntl(), lockf() can also lock - more POSIX
  4, File locks apply to the actual file, rather than the file name.
     This is important since Unix allows multiple names to refer to
     the same file. 
  5, All fcntl locks associated with a file for a given process are
     removed when any file descriptor for that file is closed by that
     process, even if a lock was never requested for that file descriptor
