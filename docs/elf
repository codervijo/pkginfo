ELF files, Linker, Loader

Objective of this note: - to include DWARF, ELF details, binary formats,
objdump, binary debug info, dlopen(), linking, vdso, .so, static linking,
dynamic linking etc. etc.


   ELF - executable and linking format (ELF) 
   DWARF - (Debug With Arbitrary Record Format) format 

   vDSO
   ====
   The  "vDSO"  (virtual  dynamic shared object) is a small shared library
   that the kernel automatically maps into the address space of all  user-
   space  applications.

   Why does the vDSO exist at all?  There are some system calls thIe kernel
   provides that user-space code ends up using frequently,  to  the  point
   that  such calls can dominate overall performance.  This is due both to
   the frequency of the call as well as the context-switch  overhead  that
   results from exiting user space and entering the kernel.

   Source
       When you compile the kernel, it will automatically compile and link the
       vDSO code for you.  You will frequently find it under the architecture-
       specific directory:
           find arch/$ARCH/ -name '*vdso*.so*' -o -name '*gate*.so*'
