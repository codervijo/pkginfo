Board/CPU performance Benchmarking
----------------------------------
  Note : I would like to pick a cpu/board based on it's compute power. With
         multi-core multi-processor boards, that becomes very hard. Question
         also arises what is the kind of load expected on the target.

         But as a goal, performance bench marking software should give a
         cumulative score (regardless of number of CPUs/Cores).

  Contenders : sysbench (install with apt)
               phronix Test suite
               bonnie++ (install with apt)
               For disk : dd(1) or scripts wrapping dd(1)
