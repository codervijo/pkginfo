Notes about bring up
  0, 12V supply with 2, 2.5A 
  1, Console port is Micro USB
  2, Boards with eMMC can NOT boot from SD card
  3, My (pro) board was marked wrong for UART DIP setting. Document on the
     website was more accurate for that.
  3, use specialized uboot from uart to get files copied to eMMC
  4, Make sure not to have any other process holding /dev/ttyUSB0 open during
     run of kwboot
  5, Use debian to start. root password : debian


Steps to run
 $ cd ../bsp
 $ sudo ./kwboot -t -b u-boot-spl-uart.kwb /dev/ttyUSB0 -B 115200n8
