3, Confusion : CPU/SoC name and board name seems to be same.
   I didn't get exact board name that Nick bought.
   But from picture on the site, it seems to be this board name: AIO-3399J

4, Confusion 2 : SD image. Most ubuntu images are in 7z, but image is not
   for SD. Find image with "SD" in its name.

5, Confusion 3 : Board doesn't power up on connecting power cable. No LED.
   Power cable was tested OK. But the power connection to the board was loose.
   Making the power stable made it boot OK.
