LVM : Linux Volume Manager
========================== 

  To use LVM, you must understand several elements. First are the regular
physical hard drives attached to the computer. The disk space on these devices 
is chopped up into partitions. Finally, a filesystem is written directly to a 
partition. By comparison, in LVM, Volume Groups (VGs) are split up into 
logical volumes (LVs), where the filesystems ultimately reside (Figure 1).

Each VG is made up of a pool of Physical Volumes (PVs). You can 
extend (or reduce) the size of a Volume Group by adding or removing 
as many PVs as you wish, provided there are enough PVs remaining to store the 
contents of all the allocated LVs. As long as there is available space in the 
VG, you can also grow and shrink the size of your LVs at will (although 
most filesystems don't like to shrink).

Steps : 1, fdisk /dev/sdc
           fdisk /dev/sdd
           fdisk /dev/sde
        2, pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1
           pvdisplay
        3, vgcreate fileserver /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1
           vgdisplay
        4, vgscan
        5, lvcreate --name share --size 40G fileserver
           lvdisplay
        6, lvcreate --name backup --size 5G fileserver
           lvdisplay
        7, mkfs.ext3 /dev/fileserver/share
