1, killall can't kill a process started with perl.
   eg. run cpan as perl cpan killall cpan will do nothing.
   It is also true for processes started as "sh XYZ"
2, timeout 10 <xyz> doesn't return error message from xyz
   but creates its own error. There should at least be an option to return
   errors and exit codes as is
